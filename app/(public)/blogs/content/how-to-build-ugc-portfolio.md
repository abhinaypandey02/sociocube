# How to Build a UGC Portfolio (Even If You’re New)

If you're just starting out as a content creator, you might be wondering:

> “How do I land paid UGC campaigns if I don’t have any past work?”

Good news: You don’t need brand deals to build a great **UGC portfolio**. In this guide, we’ll show you how to **start as a content creator**, what to include, and how to create samples that brands actually want to see.

---

## ✅ What Is a UGC Portfolio?

A **UGC portfolio** is a collection of your best content that shows brands:
- What kind of videos/photos you can create
- Your on-camera presence or storytelling style
- Your ability to match brand tones, trends, or hooks

It’s the first thing brands check when deciding whether to select you for a campaign.

## 🧱 What to Include in Your UGC Portfolio

You don’t need 20+ pieces — you need 3–5 high-quality samples. Focus on variety and clarity.

### Essentials:
- Your name, age (optional), and location
- Niche (e.g., skincare, fashion, tech)
- 2–4 short-form videos (15–60 seconds)
- 1–2 photo sets (if relevant)
- A simple intro blurb: “I create casual, ad-style product videos that feel native to TikTok and Reels.”

📌 Tip: Use [Sociocube](https://sociocube.com) to generate your UGC portfolio for free — includes stats, links, and past work in one link.

## 🎬 How to Make UGC Samples Without Brand Deals

You don’t need a paid collab to create proof of work.

### Create “Mock UGC” using products you already own:
- **Skincare**: “Why I started using this every night”
- **Gadgets**: “How this makes my desk setup way better”
- **Fashion**: “Styling this one piece in 3 ways”
- **Food**: “Taste test — new plant-based snacks”

Make sure the lighting is clean, audio is clear, and it looks like a real ad.
