# How to Get Brand Deals Without a Big Following

Think you need 10,000+ followers to get paid by brands?  
**Not anymore.**

Thanks to the rise of UGC marketing, brands in 2025 are actively looking for creators with great content skills — not just big audiences.

Here’s how to **get brand deals without followers**, and why your follower count may not matter at all.

---

## 💡 Why Brands Work With Creators Who Have No Audience

Traditional influencer marketing was all about reach. But today, **UGC brand deals** are about **content**, not clout.

Brands are now hiring creators to:
- Film product tutorials
- Shoot unboxings and reviews
- Create “TikTok-style” ads for paid media
- Provide testimonials and lifestyle shots

None of this requires posting to your own audience — just content quality.

---

## ✅ What You Need Instead of Followers

1. **A Good Phone Camera** (or basic DSLR)
2. **Basic Editing Skills** (CapCut, InShot, Canva)
3. **Confidence on Camera** (or voiceover)
4. **A Portfolio** with 2–3 example videos

That’s it. You’re now marketable.

> 💡 Many creators land their first UGC deal without ever posting to Instagram or TikTok.

## 🚀 How to Start Getting UGC Brand Deals

### 1. Join a Platform That Supports New Creators

Platforms like [Sociocube](https://sociocube.com) are built to help you:
- Apply to brand campaigns (no follower limits)
- Build a free portfolio automatically
- Get discovered based on niche and content style

No cold emails. No agency gatekeeping.

---

### 2. Create Mock Content

If you haven’t worked with brands yet, create “mock ads” for products you already use.

Examples:
- “Here’s why I switched to this skincare serum”
- “My favorite water bottle for working from home”
- “How I style this bag for every outfit”

Upload them to your portfolio or pitch deck.

---

### 3. Pitch Brands Directly (Optional)

Send a short DM or email:
> "Hey! I’m a UGC creator who makes short-form product videos for brands. I love [brand/product] and would love to send you a custom sample. Would you be open to collabing?"

Attach 1–2 samples and keep it under 100 words.

---

### 4. Apply to UGC Campaigns

Once you’ve built confidence and a few samples:
- Apply daily to open campaigns on Sociocube
- Choose brands that align with your interests
- Always personalize your application (1–2 lines)

Consistency beats luck.

## 💰 How Much Can You Earn Without Followers?

| Content Type        | Avg. Rate (USD) |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| 1 UGC Video         | $50–$200        |
| 3 UGC Photos        | $30–$100        |
| Monthly Brand Deals | $300–$1000+     |

You’re getting paid for **skill and storytelling** — not influence.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Follower count doesn’t define your value anymore.  
If you can create clean, relatable, short-form content — brands will pay.

> The only thing stopping you from landing your first brand deal is starting.

You don’t need followers — you need initiative.
