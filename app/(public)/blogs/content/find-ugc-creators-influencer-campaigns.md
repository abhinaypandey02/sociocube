# How to Find UGC Creators and Launch Influencer Campaigns in 2025

The creator economy has evolved rapidly — and in 2025, **UGC creators** (User-Generated Content creators) are the go-to choice for brands looking for authentic content, better engagement, and scalable influencer marketing campaigns.

In this blog, we’ll break down exactly how to find UGC creators and run campaigns that drive results — even if you're just starting out.

## ✅ What is a UGC Creator?

A UGC creator produces content *for* a brand rather than promoting it to their own followers. Brands use this content in ads, product pages, or social media — because it looks native, relatable, and real.

**UGC ≠ Influencing**. Think of it more like creative freelancing with a social twist.

## 🔍 How to Find UGC Creators in 2025

Here are 3 modern ways brands can discover UGC creators:

### 1. **Use UGC Creator Platforms**

Platforms like **[Sociocube](https://sociocube.com)** allow brands to:

- Filter creators by niche, location, and engagement
- Launch campaigns and get real applications
- View portfolios and performance data
- Avoid agency fees or hidden costs

This is by far the most scalable and efficient approach.

### 2. **Search Social Media Manually**

You can also search on platforms like Instagram or TikTok using hashtags like:

- `#UGCcreator`
- `#UGCpartnership`
- `#UGCads`

However, it’s time-consuming and less reliable for scale.

### 3. **Use Creator Marketplaces**

Some marketplaces let creators upload their portfolios or list pricing, but they may lack collaboration tools and real-time campaign management.
