The creator economy refers to the ecosystem of independent content creators who monetize their skills, personality, and reach — often without traditional media or agency structures.

It includes:

- Influencers and micro-influencers
- Educators, vloggers, podcasters, meme pages
- Freelancers who use content to market services

And in India, this movement is scaling fast — thanks to mobile-first users, Gen Z digital fluency, and booming demand from D2C and startup brands.
